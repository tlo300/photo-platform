# Photo Platform – project context

## What this is
A self-hosted, privacy-first photo and video platform – a Google Photos alternative.
Multi-user with full per-user storage isolation. GDPR-friendly, built for European hosting.
Open registration is off by default – users join by admin invitation only.

## Tech stack
- Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Celery
- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Database: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension
- Object storage: MinIO locally, S3-compatible (Hetzner/Scaleway) in production
- Queue: Redis + Celery
- Reverse proxy: Caddy (automatic HTTPS)
- Containerisation: Docker Compose

## Repo
- GitHub: https://github.com/tlo300/photo-platform
- Project board: https://github.com/users/tlo300/projects/1
- Default branch: main (protected – no direct pushes)

## Key architecture decisions
These exist for security and portability reasons – do not change them without creating an ADR.

- Storage keys are always namespaced: {user_id}/{asset_id}/original.ext
- Row-Level Security (RLS) is active on all user-owned tables. Always set app.current_user_id as a Postgres session variable before any query.
- Presigned URLs have a maximum expiry of 1 hour – never generate longer-lived URLs
- ALLOW_OPEN_REGISTRATION=false – new users need an admin invitation
- Thumbnails are always stripped of EXIF before storage – GPS and device info stays in the DB only
- FastAPI connects to Postgres as app_user (low-privilege, RLS enforced). Alembic uses migrator. These roles must never be swapped.
- Google Takeout sidecar timestamps take priority over embedded EXIF timestamps
- All sharing via the shares table – never expose raw storage keys to unauthenticated requests

Active milestone : 5 – Albums and organisation
Last completed  : #91 Direct file and folder upload (PR #113, 2026-03-26)
In progress     : (none)
Blocked         : (none)
```

### Handoff — 2026-03-26 (#91 Direct file and folder upload)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0020: `upload_keys JSONB NULL` and `target_album_id UUID NULL FK` added to `import_jobs`
- `ImportJob` model updated with new fields
- `POST /upload`: multipart `files[]`, optional `paths[]` (webkitRelativePath), optional `album_id` query param; magic-byte MIME validation, S3 staging, ImportJob creation, Celery task enqueue
- `process_direct_upload` Celery task in `upload_tasks.py`: downloads staged files, runs full dedup/EXIF/thumbnail pipeline, creates nested album hierarchy from folder paths, links to target album for flat uploads, deletes staging keys
- `startDirectUpload()` in `api.ts`: XHR multipart with upload-progress callback
- `/upload` page: files/folder toggle (webkitdirectory), same upload-% → polling → summary UI as `/import`
- Library nav: Upload link added between Photos and Albums
- 8 integration tests: single file, multi-file, unsupported type, no files, unauthenticated, album_id, job poll, RLS isolation — all pass

**Gotchas:**
- `validate_upload` service is NOT used here — it requires declared Content-Type to match detected MIME, which browsers mis-report for HEIC. The endpoint uses magic-bytes-only detection (same as `_ingest_one` in takeout pipeline).
- `upload_keys` stores `[{key, filename, rel_path}]` JSON in the job row; task downloads each key from S3 and deletes it after processing (regardless of ingest outcome).
- For folder uploads: if `rel_path` has directory components → `_ensure_album_path` creates the hierarchy (rooted at `target_album_id` when set). If flat upload + `target_album_id` → link directly. If neither → no album.
- `_get_or_create_album` and `_link_asset_to_album` are local copies in `upload_tasks.py` to avoid circular imports with `takeout_tasks.py`.
- No sidecar support for direct uploads — `captured_at` falls back to EXIF date, then `datetime.now()`.

**Suggested next step:** #30 Production Docker Compose config (milestone 6) or another milestone 5 item.

### Handoff — 2026-03-26 (#29 Albums UI)
**Completed:**
- Backend: `AlbumResponse` gains `asset_count` (batch subquery in `list_albums`); also added to `get_album` (from `len(rows)`) and `update_album` (scalar count)
- Backend: new `GET /albums/{id}/assets` endpoint — returns `AlbumAssetItem` list ordered by `sort_order`; avoids N+1 fetches on album detail page
- Frontend `api.ts`: `AlbumItem`, `AlbumAssetItem` types; `listAlbums`, `createAlbum`, `getAlbumAssets`, `addAssetsToAlbum`, `removeAssetFromAlbum`
- `/albums`: grid of album covers (2/3/4 cols), title, asset count, inline "New album" form
- `/albums/[id]`: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-5` photo grid; hover reveals × button to remove from album; back → Albums
- `/assets/[id]`: Albums sidebar section — dropdown of user's albums + Add button (shows "Added" after success)
- Library page: "Photos / Albums" nav in header

**Gotchas:**
- `GET /albums/{id}/assets` route must be declared before `GET /albums/{id}` in FastAPI's router because FastAPI matches paths in declaration order — currently OK because the new route is added at the bottom but uses the `/assets` suffix path, not a UUID param clash
- `AlbumResponse.asset_count` is 0 on create (new album has no assets); callers should re-fetch or update local state after adding assets
- `test_backfill_asset_retries_on_storage_error` was already failing on `main` before this PR — not introduced here

**Suggested next step:** #30 Production Docker Compose config (milestone 6) or any remaining milestone 5 items.

### Handoff — 2026-03-26 (#28 Google Takeout album import)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0019: `description TEXT NULL` on `albums`
- Album model + all API endpoints now expose `description` (create/update/list/detail)
- `_build_album_index(zf)`: pre-scans zip for folder-level `metadata.json` (album title/description) and per-photo `photoTakenTime` timestamps → sort order
- `_get_or_create_album`: accepts `description`, stored on first creation only (not overwritten on reimport)
- `_link_asset_to_album`: accepts `sort_order`; written into `album_assets.sort_order`
- `_ensure_album_path`: uses `AlbumIndex.meta` for the leaf folder's title/description; intermediate path segments keep their raw names
- `_process`: builds album index once before per-file loop, passes it to `_ingest_one`
- 12 new tests (6 unit, 6 integration); all 43 album+takeout tests pass

**Gotchas:**
- Album-level `metadata.json` (name exactly `metadata.json`) vs photo sidecars (`photo.jpg.json`) — distinguished by filename, not content
- Sort order uses `photoTakenTime.timestamp` from photo sidecars; files without sidecars fall back to alphabetical order
- `_get_or_create_album` matches on `(owner_id, title, parent_id)` — if a previous import created albums by folder name, reimporting after this feature adds new albums with the metadata title (known limitation; no auto-merge)
- Folder import path (`_ingest_one_from_path`) intentionally unchanged — no album metadata.json in generic folder imports

**Suggested next step:** #29 Albums UI.

### Handoff — 2026-03-26 (#27 Albums API CRUD)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0018: `sort_order INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` on `album_assets` + index `ix_album_assets_album_sort`
- `AlbumAsset` model: `sort_order` field added
- `POST/GET/PATCH/DELETE /albums` and `POST/DELETE /albums/{id}/assets` and `PUT /albums/{id}/assets/order`
- `GET /albums` includes `cover_thumbnail_url` (from `cover_asset_id` or first asset by sort_order)
- `DELETE /albums/{id}` removes album only — assets untouched
- 16 integration tests, all passing

**Gotchas:**
- `album_assets` uses a composite PK (album_id, asset_id); SQLAlchemy `delete()` returns rowcount correctly for detecting missing rows
- Reorder endpoint requires the caller to supply the complete current asset list — partial reorders are rejected 400

**Suggested next step:** Open PR for #27, then move to #29 Albums UI or #28 Takeout album import.

### Handoff — 2026-03-25 (#92 Extend search to EXIF metadata fields)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0017: GIN FTS index on `media_metadata(make, model)` using `simple` dictionary
- `search_assets()`: outerjoin `MediaMetadata`, `camera_vec` added to OR condition and ts_rank
- Search bar placeholder updated to "…or camera…"
- 2 new integration tests (match by make, match by model); all 10 tests pass

**Gotchas:**
- `lens_model` column does not exist — #88 added ISO/aperture/shutter_speed/focal_length/flash
  but not lens_model. That acceptance criterion is unmet and noted in the PR.
- `camera_vec` uses string concatenation (`make || ' ' || model`) rather than `concat_ws` because
  concat_ws is not needed here — both coalesces are already empty-string safe.

**Suggested next step:** Open PR for #92, then move to #27 Albums API.

### Handoff — 2026-03-25 (#88 Metadata backfill)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0016: added `iso` (Integer), `aperture` (Float), `shutter_speed` (Float, seconds),
  `focal_length` (Float, mm), `flash` (Boolean) to `media_metadata`
- `ExifResult` now has all new fields + `gps_latitude/longitude/altitude` + `duration_seconds`;
  all default to None for backward compatibility
- `extract_exif` reads new Exif sub-IFD tags (33434/33437/34855/37385/37386) + GPS IFD (34853)
  for images; uses `ffprobe` subprocess for video width/height/duration
- `apply_exif` upserts all new fields including `duration_seconds` (previously ignored)
- New `metadata.backfill_user` Celery task: sets RLS, queries all assets, fans out
  `metadata.backfill_asset` tasks
- New `metadata.backfill_asset` Celery task: downloads original, re-extracts metadata, upserts
  `media_metadata`, inserts `locations` from EXIF GPS only if no location row exists
- `POST /admin/backfill-metadata?user_id=<optional>` admin endpoint — enqueues per-user tasks,
  returns `{"enqueued": N}` (count of user tasks)
- 32 new unit tests across test_exif.py and test_metadata_backfill.py

**Gotchas:**
- Pillow does not reliably round-trip sub-IFD data for freshly created images; extended EXIF
  field tests use `patch("app.services.exif.Image.open")` to inject mock EXIF data
- `ExifResult` fields all have `default=None` — positional construction still works but
  callers that use keyword arguments (takeout_tasks, merge_metadata tests) are unaffected
- GPS → location upsert is backfill-task-only; `apply_exif` stays focused on `media_metadata`
  so the import pipeline (takeout_tasks.py) doesn't gain unexpected GPS writes
- Admin endpoint queries `users` table (no RLS) to enumerate user IDs; each Celery task sets
  its own RLS via `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id`

**Suggested next step:** Open PR for #88, then move to #27 Albums API or #92 Extend search
to EXIF metadata fields.

### Handoff — 2026-03-25 (#43 GPS location storage and geo-based browsing API)
**Completed:**
- `locations.point` GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326) column + GiST index already existed from migration 0001
- `has_location=true/false` filter was already implemented in GET /assets (from #22)
- Added `near=lat,lon` and `radius_km=N` query params to `GET /assets`
- Uses `ST_DWithin(point::geography, target::geography, metres)` — picks up the GiST index
- When `near` is active: JOIN locations, filter by ST_DWithin, order by ST_Distance ASC,
  cursor pagination bypassed (next_cursor always null)
- 8 integration tests in `tests/test_location_api.py`

**Gotchas:**
- The existing `point` column is `GEOMETRY(POINT, 4326)`, not `GEOGRAPHY`. Must cast both sides
  to `Geography` via SQLAlchemy `cast(col, Geography)` for ST_DWithin to measure in metres.
- `near` filter does a JOIN to locations, so assets without a location row are automatically
  excluded — no extra EXISTS check needed.
- Cursor pagination is incompatible with distance ordering; followed the search endpoint pattern
  of returning up to `limit` results with `next_cursor=null`.

**Suggested next step:** Open PRs for #25, #26, #43, then move to #27 Albums API.

### Handoff — 2026-03-25 (#26 Basic search)
**Completed:**
- Migration 0015: GIN functional indexes on description (english), tags.name (simple),
  and locations.display_name+country (simple)
- `GET /assets/search?q=` endpoint: full-text search via `websearch_to_tsquery`, ordered
  by `ts_rank` then `captured_at`. Empty q falls back to timeline order. No cursor —
  returns up to `limit` results with `next_cursor=null`
- Frontend: debounced search bar (300 ms) on library page; shows search results in flat
  grid, hides infinite-scroll timeline while query is active
- 8 integration tests: match by description/tag/display_name/country, empty→all,
  no-match→empty, RLS isolation, 401

**Gotchas:**
- `websearch_to_tsquery('simple', q)` used for tags and locality — 'simple' dictionary
  preserves proper nouns/place names without stemming. Description uses 'english'.
- Route `/search` must be declared before `/{asset_id}` in assets.py — FastAPI matches
  in declaration order. This is already correct.
- `func.concat_ws(" ", Location.display_name, Location.country)` handles NULL gracefully
  (skips NULL fields) — avoids `to_tsvector('simple', NULL)` errors in the outer join.
- Issue #92 created to extend search to EXIF metadata fields once #88 (backfill) is done.

**Suggested next step:** Open PRs for #25 and #26, then move to #27 Albums API or #88 Metadata backfill.

### Handoff — 2026-03-25 (#25 Asset detail view)
**Completed:**
- `GET /assets/{id}` endpoint: full-res presigned URL, metadata (make/model/dims/duration),
  GPS location (lat/lng from PostGIS ST_X/ST_Y), tags with source
- Frontend `/assets/[id]` page: full-res image or inline video, metadata sidebar,
  OSM embed iframe for GPS, tag badges with source label, sticky back button
- Scroll position save/restore via sessionStorage (grid → detail → back)
- 5 integration tests: happy path, bare asset (nulls), 404, RLS isolation, 401

**Gotchas:**
- `MediaMetadata` now has ISO/aperture/shutter_speed/focal_length/flash (added in #88)
- GPS extracted from PostGIS using `ST_Y(point)` = latitude, `ST_X(point)` = longitude
- `geoalchemy2.functions` (ST_X, ST_Y) imported in assets.py — already in requirements
- OSM embed iframe uses the official `openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html` — no npm mapping lib needed
- `worker` label doesn't exist in the repo (skipped when creating issue #88)

**Suggested next step:** Run tests (`pytest tests/test_asset_detail.py -v`), then open PR and
move to #26 Basic search or #88 Metadata backfill.
